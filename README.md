# Maze
* In this section, I learned about while, funcitons and code blocks.
* I practiced four hurdle to understand the functions and while to build the maze game.
# Note
* If the robot make infinite loop (for eg; it’s goes upto 1002 times), in that case we have to debug this issue.
* It’s because of the edge cases in the maze.
